// authenticated. It signals a throttled request with 429 and a Retry-After
// header, which gosf used to ignore outright — the request simply failed and
// the run died mid-scan (issue #86).

// without turning a genuinely exhausted quota into an unbounded hang: after
// maxRetries the 429 is returned, and the command turns it into an actionable
